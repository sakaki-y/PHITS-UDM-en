How to run the example files
##############################

Here, the path to the PHITS folder is assumed to be as follows, as in :ref:`When compiling PHITS-UDM<sec_PHITSUDM_compile>`

::

    PhitsFolder=/Users/you/phits330A/phits/

Go to the ``examples/`` folder in the folder you downloaded

::

    cd ${PhitsFolder}/phits-udm/examples

Go to the ``01/`` folder

::

    cd 01/

Run the input file (``main.inp``) in that folder with the executable you just compiled

Example) Executable file compiled on Mac, Intel Fortran.

::

    ../../../phits_MacIfort-udm < main.inp

or

::

    ${PhitsFolder}/phits_MacGfort-udm < main.inp

If successful, the following image file is generated. The particle represented by ``part = 900000`` is a user-defined particle, and ``part = nu_e`` is an electron neutrino produced by decay from the user-defined particle.

example file description
##############################

Recall that the sample user files were stored in the ``sample-code-1/`` that you downloaded.

::

    $ ls ${PhitsFolder}/phits-udm/sample-code-1/*

    udm_Manager.f90
    udm_int_sample1.f90
    udm_int_sample2.f90
    udm_part_sample1.f90
    udm_part_sample2.f90


User-defined interactions are described in ``udm_int_*.f90`` and user-defined particles in ``udm_part_*.f90``.
For details on how to create these user-defined files, see [:ref:`sec_how_to_phitsudm`].

* ``udm_int_sample1.f90``

   A sample file defining interactions between electrons or positrons and atoms. An interaction is defined where the user-defined particle will be emitted from the electron or positron.

* ``udm_part_sample1.f90``

    Neutral particle with mass 50 MeV and lifetime 0.1 ns.
    Decays into 2 or 3 electron neutrinos. (unphysical, but for simplicity)

* ``udm_Manager.f90``

    A manager file that lists the module names of the user-defined files you wish to use.


* ``examples/01/main.inp``

    :math:`2 \times 2 \times 10 ~{\rm cm}^3` water target and observe a new particle (kf-code = 900000) produced by the electron beam.

        - ``1_flux_xz.eps``

            The flux of electrons, positrons, photons, and the new particle produced by the target. Also, the flux of electron neutrinos (kf-code = 12) is produced by the decay of new particles.

        - ``2_production_energy.eps``

            Energy distribution of generated the new particle, etc.

        - ``3_decay_energy.eps``

            Energy distribution of electron neutrinos produced by the decay of the new particle.
