**PHITS-UDM (User Defined Model) is an extension to PHITS that implements new interactions and particles.**

* [:ref:`Download<sec_download>`]

------------------------

The following two sections will be introduced:

| ``[ user defined interaction ]``
| ``[ user defined particle ]``


You can also :ref:`share<user_codes>` the original source code used in your implementation with other users.

------------------------

``[ user defined interaction ]``

The user describes in templated fortran code the cross section, distribution, and incident particles that cause the interaction to be implemented. Recompiling PHITS with that code implements the interaction.

Templated fortran code is simplified. See [:ref:`sec_sample_code`] for details.

The following incident particles are supported in the current version. (Feel free to let us know if you prefer other particles.)

* Photons
* Electrons, positrons
* Muons
* Neutrinos
* User-defined particles

------------------------

``[ user defined particle ]``

The user describes the masses, lifetimes, and decay patterns of user-defined particles in templated fortran code. The interaction is implemented by recompiling PHITS with it.

The following values can be assigned as ``kf-code`` for user-defined particles:

:math:`900000 \leq |\text{kf-code}| \leq 999999`

You can use the kf-code in ``part`` of the tally section or ``proj`` of the source section.

The decay patterns and lifetimes of particles already implemented in PHITS can be easily changed.
